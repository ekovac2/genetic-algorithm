# Genetic and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for TSP
Comparison of application of ant colony optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm for solving TSP problem. Code is written in Python.

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most well-known combinatorial optimization problems. 
With the increase in the number of cities, its solution by applying mathematical methods becomes almost impossible. 
For this reason, it is better to use heuristic methods to solve this problem such as genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), 
which have been used in this project. Python programming language is used for their implementation. 
The implemented algorithms were tested over a different number of cities and with different complexity of finding the optimal route. 
Based on the obtained results, a comparison of the efficiency of these algorithms in terms of the execution time of the algorithm and the shortest distance found was performed. 
The genetic algorithm gave fairly good results for small or medium-sized problems, but is slower in terms of execution time compared to ACO. 
On the other hand, the ant colony optimization algorithm has proven to be more dominant than the genetic algorithm when applied to solve complex problems, 
but is more difficult to implement and requires more resources.
